# Article Recommender: Dataset Analysis and Model Results
# Business Understanding
In large organizations, users (customers, employees, or partners) interact with a variety of articles, such as support content, release notes, troubleshooting guides, and known errors. However, manually finding relevant articles tailored to a userâ€™s profile, needs, or past behavior is inefficient. A recommender system is needed to personalize content delivery to improve user experience and efficiency.

# Business Goals
The primary business goals of the article recommender system are:
1.	Enhance User Experience:
    Deliver articles that are most relevant to the user based on their profile, job function, or past interactions.
    Reduce the time spent searching for information.
2.	Increase Content Engagement:
o	Improve click-through rates (CTR) on articles.
o	Increase interaction rates with valuable content.
3.	Drive Operational Efficiency:
o	Proactively provide solutions to known issues (e.g., support articles) to reduce helpdesk queries.
o	Help users self-solve problems, improving organizational productivity.
4.	Improve Customer Retention and Satisfaction:
o	By addressing customer pain points effectively, satisfaction improves, increasing customer loyalty.
